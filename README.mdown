# ObjectiveHub #
An Objective-C (ARC enabled) library for version 3 of the GitHub API, for iOS 5.0+ and Mac OS X 10.7+.

The [official website](http://libobjectivehub.com/) holds an [API reference guide]((http://libobjectivehub.com/docs) and [some guides](http://libobjectivehub.com/docs/docs/guides.html) on how to work with ObjectiveHub.

The development speed and growth of ObjectiveHub is bound by the rate of the documentation. That is O(documentation), just like [nimbus](http://jverkoey.github.com/nimbus/).

## Getting Started ##
Please see the [getting started](https://github.com/rastersize/ObjectiveHub/wiki/Getting-started) wiki page or the tutorial [_Your First ObjectiveHub App_](http://libobjectivehub.com/docs/docs/guides/objectivehub101-ios.html) (or [the Mac OS X version of the tutorial](http://libobjectivehub.com/docs/docs/guides/objectivehub101-osx.html)).

## Requirements ##
Requires iOS 5.0+ or Mac OS X 10.7 during runtime and Xcode 4.2+ with the _iOS 5_ or _Mac OS X 10.7_ SDK to build.

## Documentation ##
[ObjectiveHub documentation](http://libobjectivehub.com/docs).

## Hacking ##
The project follows the [git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) model laid out by nvie in his blog-post "[A syccessful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)". This means that all development occur on the `develop` branch and the `master` branch is reserved for **stable releases**.

Furthermore, the project use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) and there will be one tag per version as well as possibly a support branch. That is when version `1.1.0` is introduced a support branch for `1.0.x` might be created as `support/1.0` and so on.

## Misc information ##
The project use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) and the git repository is maintained using [git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow). As such all active development takes place on the `develop` branch or a feature branch (prefixed with `feature/` followed by an identifier). The `master` branch is dedicated for the latest stable version.
