# ObjectiveHub #
An Objective-C (ARC enabled) library for version 3 of the GitHub API, for iOS 4.2+ and Mac OS X 10.6+.

The development speed and growth of ObjectiveHub is bound by the rate of the documentation. That is O(documentation), just like [nimbus](http://jverkoey.github.com/nimbus/).

## Getting started ##
### Usage ###
#### iOS ####
_To be written when you can actually use something._
#### Mac OS X ####
_To be written when you can actually use something._

### Requirements ###
Requires iOS 4.2+ or Mac OS X 10.6 during runtime and Xcode 4.2+ (and as such Mac OS X 10.7) to build.

## Documentation ##
[ObjectiveHub documentation](http://libobjectivehub.com/documentation).

## Hacking ##
The project follows the [git flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) model laid out by nvie in his blog-post "[A syccessful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)". This means that all development occur on the `develop` branch and the `master` branch is reserved for **stable releases**.

Furthermore, the project use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) and there will be one tag per version as well as possibly a support branch. That is when version `1.1.0` is introduced a support branch for `1.0.x` might be created as `support/1.0` and so on.
