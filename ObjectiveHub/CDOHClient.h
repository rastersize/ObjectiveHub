/**
 * Objective-C class for comunicating with GitHub asynchronously using blocks.
 *
 * Currently version 3 of the GitHub API is supported.
 *
 * **Blocks**
 *
 * - _Failure blocks_ takes exactly one argument, the error (CDOHError) which
 * was encounterred.
 * - _Success blocks_ takes exactly one argument, the response (CDOHResponse)
 * recieved from GitHub. The `resource` property models the resouce provided by
 * GitHub. More information is available through this object, such as if the
 * response is paginated and how many pages exists. The response object also
 * makes it easy to get more pages via its `-loadNextPage`, `-loadPreviousPage`
 * and `-loadPages:`.
 *
 * @TODO: We should only require a password when GitHub requires us to authenticate else we should not store it (so that we do not expose the user to unnecessary risks. That is, if the user of the library wants this and it is possible.
