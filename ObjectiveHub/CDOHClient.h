#pragma mark - ObjectiveHub Interface
/**
 * Objective-C class for comunicating with GitHub asynchronously using blocks.
 * Besides this class you will probably be very interested in the
 * CDOHClientProtocol protcol which defins all methods used to interact with
 * GitHub.
 *
 * Currently **version 3** of the GitHub API is supported.
 *
 * ### Blocks ###
 *
 * The library use two types of blocks, failure and success blocks. These blocks
 * will be called as described below on a background thread. As such you should
 * take care when updating GUI elements from within such a block. Remember to
 * always update the GUI on the main thread only (as AppKit and UIKit arenâ€™t
 * thread-safe).
 *
 * - **_Failure blocks_** takes exactly one argument, the error (CDOHError) which
 * was encounterred during the request.
 * - **_Success blocks_** takes exactly one argument, the response (CDOHResponse)
 * recieved from GitHub. The `resource` property models the resouce provided by
 * GitHub. More information is available through this object, such as if the
 * response is paginated and how many pages exists. The response object also
 * makes it easy to get more pages via its `-loadNextPage`, `-loadPreviousPage`
 * and `-loadPages:`.
 *
 *
 * ### Example Usage ###
 *
 *	#import <ObjectiveHub/ObjectiveHub.h>
 *	...
 *	
 *	- (void)loadData {
 *		NSString *username = ...
 *		CDOHClient *client = [[CDOHClient alloc] init];
 *		
 *		[client repositoriesWatchedByUser:username pages:nil success:^(CDOHResponse *response) {
 *			// Handle the respone (you will probably want to do something 
 *			// smarter than the row below).
 *			[self.watchedRepos addObjectsFromArray:response.resource];
 *			
 *			// Make sure we load all repositories watched by the user. The
 *			// success and failure blocks used in the first request will be re-
 *			// used. Just take care if the user is watching thousands of
 *			// repositories.
 *			if (response.hasNextPage) {
 *				[response loadNextPage];
 *			}
 *		} failure:^(CDOHError *error) {
 *			// Present the error or even better try to fix it for the user.
 *			[self presentError:error];
 *		}];
 *	}
 *
 * @TODO: We should only require a password when GitHub requires us to authenticate else we should not store it (so that we do not expose the user to unnecessary risks. That is, if the user of the library wants this and it is possible.
